Course project for Data Structures and Algorithms @PKU  

The 2048 1v1 board game is a 1v1 turn-based board game based on the popular game 2048.   
In this project we are supposed to design an AI model that can make decisions based on the distribution of the board and maximize its possibility of winning the battle.  

Detailed rules of the game are shown in "documents".
